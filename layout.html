        I hope you have enjoyed my assignment so far.  This is the part where my text is supposed to wrap around the picture.  Hopefully that is what is going to happen and you will see the picture to the left of this paragraph.  This paragraph will be quite a bit shorter than the second.  I had to go back and lengthen it, but you will here all about that later.  For now lets just finish up this sentece and see if this helps.

        Here goes the second paragraph.  If it worked this will be below the picture.  So far I have spent a lot of time on this website, but I have also been learning a lot.  I have been making a lot of progress, so it has not been too bad.  Let's see if this worked!!!  The good news is it worked.  So that was exciting.  The bad news is that the paragraphs are so small, in order to get the text to wrap around, I need to make the browser window very narrow.  I figured I should probably make the paragraphs longer to make it more apparant that it works.  So here I am, still trying to add more sentences.  Oh, I should probably make the first paragraph longer too.  Ok.
